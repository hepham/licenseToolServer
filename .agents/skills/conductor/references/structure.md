# Conductor Directory Structure

## Status Markers

Throughout conductor files:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending/New |
| `[~]` | In Progress |
| `[x]` | Completed (often followed by 7-char commit SHA) |
| `[!]` | Blocked (followed by reason in brackets) |
| `[-]` | Skipped (followed by reason) |

## State Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `conductor/setup_state.json` | Track setup progress for resume |
| `conductor/product.md` | Product vision, users, goals |
| `conductor/tech-stack.md` | Technology choices |
| `conductor/workflow.md` | Development workflow (TDD, commits) |
| `conductor/tracks.md` | Master track list with status |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/metadata.json` | Track metadata |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/spec.md` | Requirements |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/plan.md` | Phased task list |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/implement_state.json` | Implementation resume state |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/blockers.md` | Block history log |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/skipped.md` | Skipped tasks log |
| `conductor/tracks/<id>/revisions.md` | Revision history log |
| `conductor/refresh_state.json` | Context refresh tracking |
| `conductor/archive/` | Archived completed tracks |
| `conductor/exports/` | Exported summaries |

## Gemini CLI Compatibility

Projects set up with Gemini CLI's Conductor extension use identical structure.
The only differences are command syntax:

| Gemini CLI | Claude Code |
|------------|-------------|
| `/conductor:setup` | `/conductor-setup` |
| `/conductor:newTrack` | `/conductor-newtrack` |
| `/conductor:implement` | `/conductor-implement` |
| `/conductor:status` | `/conductor-status` |
| `/conductor:revert` | `/conductor-revert` |
| `/conductor:refresh` | `/conductor-refresh` |

Files, workflows, and state management are fully compatible.
